I did this project as part of my learning process in web development, with the goal of improving my skills in designing attractive and responsive interfaces. I chose to clone the Pinterest interface because it represents an interesting challenge: its visual design based on a masonry grid, its focus on visual content, and the fluid interaction between elements.
